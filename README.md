# Vehicle Tracking System using Azure IoT Services

## Overview
The Vehicle Tracking System project utilizes Azure IoT services to simulate a vehicle sending GPS coordinates to the cloud. This project showcases how to leverage Azure IoT Hub, Event Hub, and Blob Storage for real-time data processing and storage. The application retrieves the GPS coordinates from Azure and displays them in another application.

## Features
- **GPS Simulation**: Simulates a vehicle sending real-time GPS coordinates to Azure.
- **Azure IoT Hub Integration**: Manages communication between the vehicle simulator and Azure.
- **Event Hub for Data Streaming**: Handles high-throughput data ingestion from the vehicle.
- **Blob Storage**: Stores historical GPS data for future analysis.
- **Data Retrieval**: Fetches GPS coordinates from Azure for display in a separate application.

## Technologies Used
- **Cloud Services**: 
  - Azure IoT Hub
  - Azure Event Hub
  - Azure Blob Storage
- **Programming Languages**: 
  - C# (for the simulator and data retrieval application)
- **Simulation Tools**: Custom simulator for generating GPS data.
